# Overview

LilScan-App is a graphical interface for [LilScan](http://www.lilscan.com), a  DIY 3D laser scanner. 
It is designed for Students, Hobbyists, and Makers to learn the fundamentals of 3D sensing and point 
cloud processing by building their own 3D scanner.

The LilScan-App allows controlling multiple headless LilScan 3D scanners connected to a local network. The app includes the following features:

 * Connecting to 3D scanners
 * Control the embedded camera and lasers
 * View camera images
 * Calibrating a 3D scanner
 * Parametrization of 3D scans
 * Starting/Stopping of 3D scans
 * Downloading of 3D scans in the [PLY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLY_(file_format)) format.
 
# Installation
The app is based on [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org) and runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS as a self-maintained executable. 
Pre-compiled binaries can be downloaded from the [release page](https://github.com/lilscan/lilscan-app/releases).
